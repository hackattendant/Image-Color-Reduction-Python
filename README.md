# Color-Reduction-using-K-means-Quantization

This notebook contains a k means clustering pipeline in python.  This pipeline has been setup to use K-means to perform color reduction on images.  If you give the pipeline your value of k (the number of colors you want the image reduced to) it will plot the reduced image next to the original image, and show the energy per iteration during the K-means clustering.
